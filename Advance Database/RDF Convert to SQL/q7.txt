Depending on the size of the database determines the need for indexes
For smaller scale databases (Edmonton.txt example provided in eclass), the use of index are less
efficient compared to larger database. For the assignement (given the scale of the assignement)
the implementation of the database indexs on subject/predicate would not provide enough
additional efficiency to justify its inclusion and therefore in no included.  

However, if the database was of significant, there would be indexes created based off subjects and 
predicate. This is to speed up searches in the sqlite database, since we would no jump to the correct
starting location of each subject/predicate and therefore we do not have the need to traverse the whole
database in order to find the target subject/predicate.

The reason for a lack of indexes is because there may be too many unique object for each combination of 
subject and predicate (therefore having a index on all object may be redundant and not efficent).
