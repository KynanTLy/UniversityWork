The database is normalized for tables (airlines/airports)that have their own unique key (Airport: Airport ID, Airline: Airline) as they do not repeat (Airlines has 6048 entires with 6048 uniques, 8107 from airport with 8107 uniques) while routes has an attribute "equipment" that could be broken up into its own table therefore the routes table is not normalized.
