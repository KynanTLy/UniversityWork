Question 1:
	A) None of the files are unique/separate because the inode for File 1, 7 are the same as well as File 2, 8. Therefore they are not unique.
	   Files 3,5 are soft links to File 1 and Files 4,6 are soft links to File 2 and therefore they are not separate. But Files 1,2 are different from
	   eachother.
	B) The reason it has 2 links is because one of those link is itself "./" the other is the parent "../" Therefore it has 2 
	   Links instead of the one.
	C) The "2" is still there because the file did not create a link to the directory in question.
	D) When you create a new directory inside it, it changes the number of links from "2" to "3" because the new directory's
	   ../ is linked to the previous directory therefore changing it from "2" to "3".

Question 2:
	A) It does not show any difference because it is a soft link not a hard link.
	B) There is no indication that there was a link created because we created a soft link not a hard link.
	C) It allows you to create the link / the link did not get deleted. Without giving an error message. 
	D) It gives the error message of "too many level of symbolic links" because it tries to open itself forever.

Question 3:
	A) Now both the file created in 1.c and the newly created hard links has a total number of link count = 2. This is because 
	   hard links has the same file content of the file it is a link to. Therefore since the new hardlink to file of 1.c has the same content as
	   the file of 1.c (with 2 links) it therefore has 2 links as well.  
	B) The orginal file and the hard link undergo the same changes.
	C) There is no difference outside the file name that can be determinded from ls -l.
	D) When the orginal is deleted the link remain because they are separate files. 
	E) Hard links are not allowed for directories, and not possible with non-existent files.
